# AgenticOps Domain Architecture

## Core Concept: Value Delivery

The fundamental purpose of AgenticOps is to facilitate value delivery through structured workflows. Value is explicitly defined by and measured against client needs, where clients (a.k.a. users) can be both internal stakeholders and external customers. Every workflow component exists to support this primary objective.

### Value Definition
- Value is client-centric and defined by client needs
- Is delivered by work items.
- Can be delivered to both internal and external clients
- Measured through specific, client-relevant metrics and acceptance criteria
- Continuously validated against client feedback

## Domain Model Overview

AgenticOps implements a hierarchical workflow architecture designed to support value delivery through work items. Each level of the hierarchy contributes to ensuring work items deliver maximum value to clients.

### Core Domain Concepts

#### 1. Funnel
The highest level of workflow organization, representing a complete value stream. Funnels organize the entire value delivery process, ensuring work items flow efficiently from conception to client delivery. They provide a high-level view of the entire value creation and delivery process.

#### 2. Phase
A major segment within a funnel, representing a distinct part of the value creation and delivery process. Phases break down the value stream into logical segments that contribute to the overall value proposition. Each phase represents a significant step in transforming work items into client value.

#### 3. Stage
A specific set of activities within a phase, with defined purpose and goals aligned with client value. Stages define concrete objectives that directly contribute to client value creation. They provide clear checkpoints for ensuring work items are progressing toward valuable outcomes.

#### 4. WorkflowStep
The atomic unit of work within a stage, defining specific activities that create or enhance value expressed as work items. WorkflowSteps define the actual work to be performed, each contributing to the creation or enhancement of client value through specific actions and transformations.

### Supporting Domain Objects

#### 1. Role
Defines responsibilities and authorizations within workflow steps, ensuring proper execution and accountability in value delivery.

#### 2. Input
Specifies required resources, information, or prerequisites needed for a workflow step to create value.

#### 3. Notification
Manages communication within the workflow to ensure timely and effective value delivery.

#### 4. Meeting
Structures collaborative sessions within the workflow to align on value creation and delivery.

#### 5. Output
Defines the valuable artifacts or outcomes produced by workflow steps that contribute to client value.

#### 6. Event
Defines triggers that can occur within workflows, enabling responsive and dynamic value delivery.

#### 7. EventHandler
Defines responses to workflow events, ensuring appropriate actions are taken to maintain value flow.

#### 8. AutomationHook
Defines integration points with external systems to enhance and accelerate value delivery.

## Domain Relationships

### Value Flow Structure
```
Funnel (Value Stream)
  └── Phase (Value Transformation)
       └── Stage (Value Creation Point)
            └── WorkflowStep (Value Action)
                 ├── Roles & Inputs
                 ├── Activities & Outputs
                 └── Events & Automation
```

### Key Relationships
- Funnels represent complete value streams that deliver work items to clients
- Phases transform work items through distinct value-adding segments
- Stages provide checkpoints where specific client value is created
- WorkflowSteps execute the actual value-creating activities
- Supporting objects (Roles, Inputs, etc.) enable and enhance value creation

## Value-Centric Domain Rules

1. **Value Definition**
   - Each workflow must have clearly defined value incomes and outcomes
   - Value must be measurable and tied to client needs
   - Client feedback mechanisms must be integrated at appropriate points

2. **Value Validation**
   - Regular validation of value delivery against client expectations
   - Feedback loops for continuous value assessment
   - Metrics focused on value realization

3. **Value Stream Efficiency**
   - Minimize time between value request, creation, and delivery
   - Eliminate steps that don't contribute to client value
   - Optimize resource allocation based on value contribution

## Persistence

The domain model is persisted in PostgreSQL with a normalized schema that mirrors the domain structure. Key features of the persistence layer:

1. **Identity Management**
   - All entities use SERIAL PRIMARY KEYs
   - Foreign key relationships maintain referential integrity

2. **Naming Conventions**
   - Snake_case for database objects
   - Consistent plural naming for tables

3. **Data Integrity**
   - NOT NULL constraints on essential fields
   - Foreign key constraints to maintain relationships
   - Default values for Index fields

## Domain Services

The domain model supports several key services:

1. **Value Stream Management**
   - Work item tracking through value stream
   - Value delivery monitoring
   - Client feedback integration
   - Value metrics analysis

2. **Client Need Management**
   - Client requirement tracking
   - Value definition and validation
   - Feedback collection and analysis

3. **Event Processing**
   - Event detection and triggering
   - Condition evaluation
   - Action execution

4. **Automation Integration**
   - External system integration
   - API call execution
   - Response handling

5. **Role-based Access Control**
   - Permission management
   - Role assignment
   - Access verification

## Future Considerations

1. **Enhanced Value Metrics**
   - Advanced value stream analytics
   - Predictive value delivery modeling
   - Client satisfaction prediction

2. **Value Stream Optimization**
   - AI-driven workflow optimization
   - Automated value bottleneck detection
   - Dynamic resource allocation

3. **Versioning**
   - Workflow versioning
   - Change tracking
   - Version migration

4. **Template Support**
   - Workflow templates
   - Best practice patterns
   - Reusable components

5. **AI Integration**
   - Workflow optimization
   - Predictive analytics
   - Automated decision support
